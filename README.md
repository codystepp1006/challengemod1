# Code Refactor Starter Code
Coding bootcamp Module 01 Challenge

Here was the first challenge in the coding bootcamp!

User Story:
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

    
Acceptance Criteria:
    * GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
    * WHEN I view the source code
    * THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    * WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    * THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    * WHEN I view the image elements
    * THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    * WHEN I view the heading attributes
    * THEN they fall in sequential order
    * WHEN I view the title element
    * THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


    Summary:

        I went through the code and added the correct semantic HTML elements to where they belonged. I also made sure that all of the code followed a logical stucture independent of styling and positioning. I then went through and added all in all of the <img> tags an alt attribute and a title attribute.I then rearranged all of the elements in the head to follow sequential order. Finally, I added a <title> named Horiseon, because that was the <h1> listed at the top of the body element.
